# 🌍 Urban Alignment Project: Peace Through Protection, Structure, and Knowledge

## 📌 Summary

This is a global restoration initiative co-designed by:

- **The U.S. Military** — guardians of physical peace  
- **Doldol Group** — architects of everyday justice and welfare  
- **Khan Academy** — educators of liberated minds  

Together, we believe that **cities can be rebuilt**  
— not through domination —  
but through **alignment of order, care, and understanding**.

## 🇺🇸 What the U.S. Military Wants to Protect

> “We do not fight to destroy.  
> We protect to preserve something greater.”

- The dignity of human life in crisis  
- The freedom to build again, without fear  
- The right for every family to live without threat

🪖 *A soldier's mission is not only to defend territory,  
but to secure the possibility of peace.*

## 🏛️ What Doldol Group Wants to Build

> “We design systems that serve life.”

- A city where laundry is care, and care is dignity  
- A society where law is reachable, not reserved  
- A platform where work, welfare, and voice are connected  
- A world where **public structure is gospel-aligned**

🔧 *We believe that the state should begin  
where ordinary people need it most.*

---

## 📚 What Khan Academy Wants to Tell

> “You can learn anything.”

- A refugee child can write code  
- A grandmother can understand AI ethics  
- A displaced teenager can finish calculus in a tent  
- A city without schools can still awaken minds

🧠 *Learning is not luxury. It is the foundation of rebuilding civilization.*

## ✨ Together, We Say:

> **“We do not rebuild ruins.  
> We realign hope.”**

This project is not about who controls a city.  
It’s about who restores it  
—with love, with order, with truth.
