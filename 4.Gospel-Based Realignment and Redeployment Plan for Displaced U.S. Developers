# 🌍 Gospel-Based Realignment and Redeployment Plan for Displaced U.S. Developers

_A strategic architecture by Sanggi Park (박상기) for rebuilding global civic infrastructure through gospel ethics, AI alignment, and human dignity._

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository outlines a global reconstruction project to:

- Identify displaced U.S. software and hardware engineers (post Big Tech layoffs)
- Re-align them through gospel-based education via [University of the People](https://www.uopeople.edu)
- Deploy them into global standard cities through the [Doldol Group](https://github.com/psg1616) ecosystem
- Restore ethical labor infrastructure at the intersection of **AI, welfare, logistics, education, law, and gospel order**
