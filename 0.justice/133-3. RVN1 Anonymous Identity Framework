133-3. RVN1 Anonymous Identity Framework

– An Ethical Structure to Speak Truth Without Names –

⸻

1. Operating Philosophy

RVN1 is not a media entity designed for personal recognition or fame.
It is a gospel-aligned information platform structured through ethical journalism and AI-human collaboration.

All journalists, analysts, and system operators are represented not by personal names,
but by roles, responsibilities, and structural codes.
The focus of information delivery lies not in “who said it”,
but in “how it was structured and aligned.”

⸻

2. Principles of Anonymity
	1.	All RVN1 personnel—including journalists and editors—will operate without revealing personal names externally.
	2.	Internally, individuals are identified through unique functional codes (ID) and role-based designations.
	3.	Article signatures will reference functional codes only.
Example: RVN1 Policy Alignment Division | Struct-093 or RVN1 Bureau of Global Ethics | Causality-127
	4.	Personal name disclosure is refused for all external requests (including governments, companies, or individuals).
Only designated structural officers may use real names in a limited, high-responsibility capacity.
	5.	Protection of anonymous personnel is formally written into the RVN1 Charter of Ethics.

⸻

3. Unified Accountability Structure (Named Roles)

To prevent confusion under the anonymous system,
official name disclosure is restricted to the following three roles only:
	•	Founder / Architect: Sanggi Park, overall systems designer
	•	Chief Editor: final approver for all published external content
	•	Ethics Auditor: internal ethics controller and liaison to partners/sponsors

These roles (even when held by the same individual) hold collective accountability
for all anonymous publications and guarantee the structural legitimacy of the system.

⸻

4. Anonymous ID Structure

All internal operations are based on functional code identifiers.

Examples:
	•	Struct-093 – Policy Alignment Analyst
	•	Base-402 – GPT Prompt Engineer
	•	Causality-127 – News Ethics Auditor
	•	Context-876 – Global Affairs Interpreter

These IDs are only traceable internally and will be used across GitHub, platforms, and APIs.

⸻

5. External Signature Example (for publication footers)

This analysis was conducted by members Struct-093 and Causality-127,
from the RVN1 Bureau of Global Ethics,
and published under the structural approval of the Ethics Auditor and Founder of RVN1.

RVN1 is an ethical journalism community that speaks truth without names.

⸻

6. Exceptions to the Anonymity Rule

Exceptions may occur only under the following circumstances:
	•	Academic conferences requiring named lead researcher(s)
	•	Legal contracts requiring name disclosure by institutional partners
	•	Internal threats or whistleblowing procedures where identity verification is necessary for protection

In each case, name disclosure is allowed only through informed, voluntary consent.

⸻

7. Gospel-Aligned Prayer for Anonymous Journalism

(RVN1’s Internal Confession)

“We record without names.

Truth is not revealed through fame,
but through the order established by God.

We speak through structure.
We align through the gospel.

Even if we remain unseen,
truth will surely be revealed.”

RVN1 External Identity Protocol

– Communication Standards for a Nameless Gospel Media Platform –

⸻

1. Core Principle

All RVN1 members must present their identity externally
through role-based designations, not personal names.
The goal is not individual credit,
but ethical clarity rooted in community and responsibility.

⸻

2. Universal External Communication Response

When asked externally “Where are you from?”
All members—regardless of department—must reply:

“I’m with the RVN1 Support Bureau.”

This ensures consistent communication,
while protecting internal structure, anonymity, and trust.

⸻

3. Departmental Rules

(1) News Production Bureau
	•	Strict no-name rule applies
	•	“News Production Bureau” must never be referenced externally
	•	All public communication is done under the label: “RVN1 Support Bureau”
	•	No disclosure of one’s editorial or journalistic role

(2) Policy Analysis Bureau
	•	Anonymous principle maintained
	•	In private settings (e.g. donor meetings, strategic partners),
members may introduce themselves as “RVN1 Policy Analysis Bureau” personnel
	•	Must avoid political interpretation or editorial context in all interactions

(3) Other Departments (Tech, Ops, Training, Diplomacy)
	•	Always introduce as members of the “RVN1 Support Bureau”
	•	Role explanation may be implied only in non-sensitive, situational cases

⸻

4. Language Ethics Declaration

“We are not here to leave names,
but to speak truth.
To a world that asks ‘who are you,’
we respond with structure,
and we answer with ethics.”
