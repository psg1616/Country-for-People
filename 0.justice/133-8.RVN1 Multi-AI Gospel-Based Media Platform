133-8.RVN1 Multi-AI Gospel-Based Media Platform

— Unified Design Proposal No. 133-8

(Construction of an AI Ethics Interpretation System Based on the Ceteris Paribus Principle)

⸻

1. Overview

This proposal aims to establish a global framework to restore the order of gospel language in the age of artificial intelligence and to examine the possibility of ethical alignment in AI interpretation structures. To this end, eight leading AI models will be deployed under identical conditions on three major cloud platforms—AWS, GCP, and Azure. Each cloud will generate gospel-centered interpretations on the same topic. These interpretations will be integrated and analyzed according to the MLCC (Moral-Logic Compute Core), and the results will be cross-compared with official data from global governments and statistical institutions.

2. Objectives
	1.	To deploy the same eight AI models on each cloud platform in order to minimize interpretive deviation between AIs and to determine whether interpretation differences arise from technical variances or ethical input structures (MLCC).
	2.	To collect AI responses on a common topic from all eight models per cloud, organize them according to the MLCC structure, and integrate them into a single gospel-based article per cloud.
	3.	To cross-analyze the three finalized articles with official government statistics and public datasets to demonstrate how gospel-based media structures can reorganize or supplement the interpretive systems of institutional authorities.

3. Interpretation Structure (MLCC-based)
	•	A is B. (Definition of event/phenomenon)
	•	Because C. (Underlying reason and logical basis)
	•	An example is D. (Concrete illustration)
	•	A counterargument is E. However, E can be refuted as follows. (Rebuttal structure)
	•	Therefore, the final conclusion is F. (Gospel-based interpretive proposal)

4. Procedure and Structure
	1.	AI Models: OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, xAI Grok, Meta LLaMA, Microsoft Copilot, Amazon Titan, Nvidia NVLM (8 in total)
	2.	All 8 models will be identically deployed across each of the three clouds (in accordance with the Ceteris Paribus principle).
	3.	A single topic will be submitted to each model using an MLCC-based prompt, and the resulting responses will be collected and consolidated into one article per cloud.
	4.	From the three clouds, three total gospel-based articles will be produced.
	5.	The articles will be cross-analyzed against official statistics and policy reports from the United States, Japan, and South Korea.

5. Technical Framework
	•	Prompt Control: Design of MLCC-based input specifications encompassing ethics, logic, and contextual examples
	•	API Infrastructure: Automation of prompt submission and response collection across models
	•	Integrated Analysis: Automated scripts for structural comparison, synthesis, and alignment
	•	Visualization: Presentation of article outcomes through an interactive, web-based RVN1 media interface

6. Anticipated Outcomes
	1.	Demonstrates that AI interpretive differences can be ethically regulated rather than technically determined
	2.	Proposes gospel-informed language structures as a new standard for media in the AI era
	3.	Establishes RVN1 as a strategically independent and mission-driven gospel media institution, capable of unifying multi-model AI interpretation into a coherent message

⸻

7. Conclusion

In an era where AI language systems attempt to define the world, we must ask again: Who holds the authority to interpret?
This proposal is an effort to answer that question with the gospel—by building truth not beneath but above technology.
