133-1. RVN1 Standard Analytical Framework

(Standard Analytical Framework for Aligned Journalism)

⸻

Definition

The Standard Analytical Framework is RVN1’s core strategy for selecting and ethically reinterpreting key global information based on official media, government statements, and international data reports.
It enables the delivery of truth without risking human life, through a structured approach where AI and human analysts cooperate under gospel-aligned ethics.

⸻

Focus of Analysis

Rather than focusing on direct field reporting, RVN1 emphasizes interpretation and structural analysis.
Primary sources include:
	•	Official government announcements
	•	State-run news articles
	•	Legislative and administrative documents
	•	National statistical releases
	•	Reports from global institutions such as the UN, IMF, and World Bank

Unofficial rumors or private testimonies are strictly excluded.
The emphasis is on interpreting the intentional public language of a state, not its gossip or subtext.

Analysis Procedure
	1.	Data Collection
	•	Key documents are gathered through GPT-based automated crawlers and RSS feeds.
	2.	Summarization Phase
	•	The GPT model provides first-level summarization, outlining the core data structure.
	3.	Quantitative Verification
	•	Statistical and budgetary claims are validated against public datasets to assess the consistency between what is said and what is structured.
	4.	Ethical Evaluation
	•	Content is examined through the lens of five gospel ethics:
Love, Justice, Life, Order, and Perseverance.
	•	The goal is to assess structural accountability and ethical intent.
	5.	Alignment Assessment
	•	Based on the above, each policy or statement is categorized into one of three ethical signals:
	•	Aligned (Trustworthy)
	•	Caution (Structural Discrepancy)
	•	Warning (Hypocrisy or Danger)
	6.	Editorial Publication
	•	Finalized briefings are prepared by the editorial team and published as country-specific alignment reports.

⸻

Ethical Criteria

RVN1’s guiding questions are:
	•	Does this policy genuinely benefit the vulnerable?
	•	Is love and order manifested through structure, not just language?
	•	Does this report pose any risk to human life?

RVN1 strictly avoids:
	•	Emotionally manipulative narratives
	•	Fear-based messaging
	•	Politically charged speculation

Even GPT-generated content must be reviewed by human ethical editors before publication.

⸻

Operational System

The entire system runs on cloud-based infrastructure.
Key components (data collectors, summarizers, ethical scoring models, and editorial tools) are hosted via AWS or Azure.
Content visualization and archiving are maintained through GitHub Pages, Notion, and Google Data Studio.

Thanks to automation and structural clarity, RVN1 can operate globally with a lean team:
	•	1–2 AI ethics operators
	•	Fewer than 10 regional analysts per language cluster

⸻

Applications and Use Cases

This model enables journalism in war zones, authoritarian states, and high-risk areas —
without exposing journalists to physical danger.
It can also be adopted as:
	•	A model for ethical journalism curricula
	•	GPT training datasets
	•	A foundational tool for international AI ethics research and development

⸻

Conclusion

The RVN1 Standard Analytical Framework is more than a method for journalistic efficiency.
It is a system of information ministry — connecting structure, life, ethics, and the gospel.
This framework does not exist to surveil or provoke, but to illuminate the world through aligned, ethical reporting.

It is not a defense mechanism.
It is a declaration of order.
And it begins now.
