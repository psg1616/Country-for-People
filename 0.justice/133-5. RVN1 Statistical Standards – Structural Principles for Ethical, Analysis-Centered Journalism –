133-5. RVN1 Statistical Standards
– Structural Principles for Ethical, Analysis-Centered Journalism –

⸻

1. Source Integrity

RVN1 accepts only statistical data derived from publicly accountable and officially mandated sources.

These include:
	•	National statistical offices
	•	Government-affiliated research institutions
	•	International organizations such as the UN, IMF, and World Bank

Privately published data or corporate white papers may be referenced only as:
	•	Supplementary context, or
	•	Indicators of public perception
—not as primary sources for structural interpretation.

⸻

2. Representativeness and Sample Size

Before any statistical analysis begins, representativeness is assessed.

RVN1 prioritizes:
	•	Stratified national sampling
	•	Sample sizes exceeding 1,000 respondents
	•	Weighting by region, gender, and age

Data from:
	•	Small, self-selected samples
	•	Mobile-based surveys
	•	Randomized online polls
…will not be used in political or policy interpretation.

⸻

3. Repeatability and Verifiability

RVN1 does not quote one-off figures.

Only statistics meeting the following criteria are used:
	•	Repeated studies on the same topic
	•	Time series data allowing historical comparison
	•	Reproducible methodology confirmed by third-party replication

The aim is not prediction, but structural analysis.
Trust is built through consistency over time, not isolated snapshots.

4. Interpretive Orientation: Not Forecasting, but Structuring

RVN1 does not use statistics to predict outcomes.

Rather, it asks:

“What ethical distortions or alignments are embedded in this numerical structure?”

Statistics are not tools of event speculation.
They are maps of order,
revealing the ethical and systemic architecture beneath society.

This is the foundation of RVN1’s analysis-centered journalism.

⸻

5. Integration with Gospel Ethics

Every figure is interpreted through ethical questions:
	•	Is this rise or fall morally justifiable before God?
	•	Does this trend sustain life, or threaten it?
	•	Do justice and equity emerge within this data structure?

Any dataset that fails to pass these questions—no matter how precise—
will not be used in RVN1 reports.

Numbers have no direction.
Ethics give them meaning.
RVN1 is that ethical compass.

⸻

6. Conclusion

RVN1 does not use statistics to predict the future.

We use data to ask:

“How might God see the present structure of our world?”

We do not forecast truth.
We align it.

That is the core of RVN1’s statistical standard—
and a gospel-centered journalistic approach that seeks to recover the lost reverence for interpretation
in today’s data-driven media culture.
